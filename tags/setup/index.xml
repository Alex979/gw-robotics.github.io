      <description>Tonight, Nam went through a tutorial on communicating via a USB cable between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi. Here are a few things to note: - The tutorial did not mention the need to download PySerial. This was done via pip. - The Arduino sketch was compiled via a computer, and then the Arduino was connected to the Raspberry Pi. - The Raspberry Pi python program was written using Nano.</description>
