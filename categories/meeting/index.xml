      <description>Today was the first software team meeting! As there is no finalised robot design, there was not much to talk about code-wise. Instead, points discussed during the GroupMe chat was just reiterated. They are as follows:
 Using Python on a Raspberry Pi to do most of the logic Using C/Arduino on an Arduino to get sensor input and output to motor controllers Arduino and Raspberry Pi will communicate through Serial protocols GitHub and Git will be used to manage the code The programming projects are as follows:  Driving Vision Baby grabbing mechanism Fire Extinguisher Mapping    The goal for the next programming meeting is to have more members, as well as start talking about pseudo-code.</description>
