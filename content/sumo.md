# About The Competition

Robot-sumo is a popular type of robotics competition in which teams create robots of various sizes, with the objective of pushing the other teams' robots out of a ring (much like normal sumo wrestling).

This Sumo Robot Competition is GW-hosted robot-sumo competition, with an emphasis on being as student-friendly and accessible as possible.

Instructions on building the robot kit can be found [here](https://github.com/GW-Robotics/Generic-Robot-Platform/wiki).
