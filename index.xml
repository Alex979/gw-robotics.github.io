      <title>SEAS Innovation Challenge - Start</title>

      <description>We have been selected to receive a free Raspberry Pi kit for the SEAS Innovation challenge! The components of the kit can be found from the product site here.
The goal is to have the Raspberry Pi configured for use with the robot (expect a guide for that soon) over winter break and for a basic roadmap to be made for where to go with the project.
Stay tuned for updates on the progress.</description>

      <description>This tutorial is for installation of OpenCV for Python on a Windows PC from prebuilt files. A fully detailed tutorial can be found at the OpenCV documentation.
To Install OpenCV and Dependencies First, make sure that your computer has the right Python setup with Numpy. Matplotlib is optional and is mostly for use with the tutorials. You can check that you have Python 2.7.whatever using:
python -V  After verifying that you have Python 2.</description>

      <description>TL;DR We talked about drivetrain design.
It was confirmed that we are not using a suspension system on the middle wheels with the H-drive. This decision was mainly to avoid complexity. The issue of the wheels hitting something was discussed and the possible sensors needed to detect that. It was decided that we just won&amp;rsquo;t hit anything unexpected, or use the ultrasonic sensor to detect if we do by chance. It was also stated that the frame will be above the wheels, allowing us to move the wheels to the edge of the size constraint.</description>

      <description>Tonight, Nam went through a tutorial on communicating via a USB cable between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi. Here are a few things to note: - The tutorial did not mention the need to download PySerial. This was done via pip. - The Arduino sketch was compiled via a computer, and then the Arduino was connected to the Raspberry Pi. - The Raspberry Pi python program was written using Nano.</description>

      <description>Today was the first software team meeting! As there is no finalised robot design, there was not much to talk about code-wise. Instead, points discussed during the GroupMe chat was just reiterated. They are as follows:
 Using Python on a Raspberry Pi to do most of the logic Using C/Arduino on an Arduino to get sensor input and output to motor controllers Arduino and Raspberry Pi will communicate through Serial protocols GitHub and Git will be used to manage the code The programming projects are as follows:  Driving Vision Baby grabbing mechanism Fire Extinguisher Mapping    The goal for the next programming meeting is to have more members, as well as start talking about pseudo-code.</description>

      <description>Robotics is a pretty difficult and complex topic, so here are some of the most commonly asked questions we hear. If you have a question not mentioned here, feel free to email us.
1. WHAT IS A ROBOT? A robot is a machine that can complete a task that affects an environment.
2. HOW DO I JOIN? All you have to do is show up to a meeting! We meet (almost) every Wednesday night in Funger 223 at 9pm.</description>
